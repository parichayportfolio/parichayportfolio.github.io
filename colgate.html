                    Colgate-Palmolive India Ltd is engaged in oral care products such as of toothpaste, tooth powder, toothbrush, mouthwash and personal care products. The oral care market in India is &#8377;14,460 crores in 2022 and Colgate Palmolive already has 35.27% market share of total oral care market. Their flagship brand <i>Colgate</i> is one of the most recognized oral care brands in India.<br><br>

                    The product portfolio includes various SKUs of toothpaste, tooth powder, toothbrush, mouthwash and personal care products. They are sold under its well-recognized brands i.e. Colgate and Palmolive. They have 51% market share in toothpaste segment, 48% in toothpowder and ~30% share in the toothbrush segment. They cater to all types of oral care needs of all age groups and diverse geographical locations (urban and rural).<br><br>

                    Colgate Palmolive India Ltd is a subsidairy of Colgate Palmolive Company USA which holds 51% stake in it. They pay royalty to its parent Colgate Palmolive USA Company for usage of its know-how and intellectual property. Colgate Palmolive India paid 4.9% of it's revenues as royality to Colgate Palmolive USA. <br><br>

                    <strong>The Oral Care Market:</strong> Colgate Palmolive will remain the winner in oral care market (Toothpaste, Toothbrush, Floss, Tooth Powder, Mouthwash). They have products related to facewash (Palmolive Face Cleansing) but I don't think they are going to crack the market that well, as they did in oral care. India is already a $1.77bn market in 2022 which is tiny as compared to USA, which is a $9.62bn market and China, which is a $6.33bn market. Colgate's predominant business continues to be Oral Care and the outlook for the oral health industry is positive given the size of the opportunity.<br><br>

                    The rapidly changing lifestyles and sugar-rich diets have made Oral health, one of the key public health concerns in almost every part of the world. In India, while Oral Care category penetration is high (+95%), more than 80% of people don’t brush their teeth at night. This against the backdrop of increasing Oral Diseases, up to 77 % suffering from Gum problems every year, up to 71% children (12 years old) and upto 86.4% adults 35-45 years from Cavities, presents a situation that needs immediate attention.<br><br>

                    Online sales for oral care products is 10.7% in FY22 compared to offline sales of 89.3%. In other words, people are buying oral care products from offline stores till now, which is beneficial for companies with strong distribution network. This will shift in the coming years as more and more people start buying things online. The battle will remain all about brands competing for more online presence.<br><br>

                    <strong>Competitive Advantages (Business Moats):</strong> Colgate has a strong parent brand helping out with various research and development costs. There have been a strong competition from Pepsodent (HUL), Dabur Red Paste or Meswak, Dant Kanti (Patanjali) and other small players. But, Colgate surpassed everyone due to their ability to know their customer needs better than anyone else.<br><br>

                    <i>Colgate's Advertising -</i> Colgate Strong Teeth is their largest single brand, which was advertised as ‘Daant strong toh main strong’ Ad. Colgate Visible White O2, with #SmileOutLoud campaign, promises whiter teeth in 3 days, when used as directed. Colgate Toothpaste for Diabetics was introduced by informing the consumers about the rather unknown link between Type II diabetes and gum problems. Colgate positioning it's toothbrushes as ‘Smart Brush for a Healthy Mouth’. Colgate ZigZag is designed for germ protection against ~700 types of germs in the mouth that can cause oral care problems. On the other hand, Colgate Gentle which give superior foam resulting in the softest brushing experience. Colgate Super Flexi toothbrush, #1 selling toothbrush brand.<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/colgate-dcf/colgate_st.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <i>Colgate's R&D -</i> Colgate are working on recyclable tubes that help reducing waste generation and ultimately waste diverted towards landfill. Non-aqueous toothpaste does not contain water in the formula which reduces the Company’s water consumption. The recyclable tubes was rolled out on Colgate Active Salt and Colgate Vedshakti.  Colgate RecyClean - a first of its kind toothbrush with bristles that are plant derived and Bisphenol A (BPA) free while the handle is made from 100% recycled plastic.<br><br>

                    Colgate have 35% of the total oral care market in the palm of their hands. They need to keep doing what they do - Pull out ridiculously high returns on their existing projects.<br><br>

                    <strong>Potential in Oral Care Industry:</strong> Demand for herbal toothpaste is increasing in India and more and more companies are trying to launch more herbal variants as they can. In toothbrushes, one is manual toothbrush and the other is electric toothbrush. Manual toothbrushes have a huge potential in Indian oral care market whereas electric toothbrush is a niche product type with limited number of rich people.<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/colgate-dcf/colgate_ecom.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    Toothpowder category is at a declining stage due to changing consumer taste and preferences. Some years ago, toothpowder had a huge presence in rural India but now even they are shifting towards toothpaste. Mouthwash category is another huge part of oral care market as consumers are bending towards mouthwash products for better oral hygiene.<br><br>

                    <strong>Revenues to Profits:</strong> Colgate's biggest expenditure are advertising/marketing expense, royality expense to parent company, which are not really expenses in my eyes. They reinvested about 25% of their earnings in FY22 and made a whopping 104% return on capital. They make 28.76% operating margin in FY22, which is due to the brand name Colgate attached to the product. Companies with big brands usually pull out high OPM's, look at Apple for instance!<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/colgate-dcf/colgate_fin_high.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <strong>Strong Competition:</strong> Strong competition comes from Pepsodent (HUL), Dabur Red Paste or Meswak, Dant Kanti (Patanjali) and other small players. Taking into consideration that there is still a big market left out there to capture, this can be anyone's game! Dant Kanti (Patanjali) took off as a <i>"India's Ayurvedic Toothpaste"</i>, as Indians believe ayurvedic products are more reliable. CloseUp (HUL) is targeted towards young adults, and positioned as mouthwash cum toothpaste.<br><br>

                    <span class="head1">My Narrative and Valuation</span><br><br>

                    Based on the key pointers and fundamentals, here are some forecasts and judgements that I made to value Colgate Palmolive Ltd. It can be wrong, it's a forecast overall!<br><br>

                    <strong>1) The Market Size:</strong> India is already a $1.77bn (&#8377;14,460 crores) market in 2022 which is tiny as compared to USA, which is a $9.62bn market and China, which is a $6.33bn market. I expect the oral care market size to increase by CAGR of 7.16%. In other words, doubling the current oral care market size by the end of 10 years. Ofcourse there is no good way to gauge how oral care awareness will lead to a percentage increase of sales, so I doubled the current market size and played with the CAGR to reach my goal. Job Done! One argument that I can clear out, I could have paired Indian market size with China's (similar population numbers). But that means 3.5 times the current market, which looks unrealistic to me at the moment. Maybe in the future!<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/colgate-dcf/market.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <strong>2) The Market Share:</strong> Colgate have 35.27% market share of the total oral care market in FY22. I believe they can pull off 40% of total oral care market at the end of 10 years. Maybe they can take more, who knows? I understand Colgate is already a top leader in toothpaste market with over a 50% market share, but the total oral market is not about toothpastes only. There is big mouthwash and floss market out there, which is starting to take some steps in India. Can colgate crack into those markets? Definitely! Am I 100% sure? Nobody is! Even me giving Colgate 40% of total oral care is pretty close to being untouchable in oral care market. And if they do better, good surprise for investors!<br><br>

                    <strong>3) Revenues:</strong> Based on the market size and market share, I forecasted the revenues to go from &#8377;509,978.19 lakhs to &#8377;1,154,929.13 lakhs. Revenues are market size multiplied by market share. I could have put a CAGR on revenues on revenues and be done in 5 minutes. But, the market perspective growth seems more realistic and understandable to me.<br><br>

                    <strong>4) Operating Margin:</strong> Companies with good brand names usually have a high operating margin, and this is the case with Colgate too. Colgate pulled out 28.76% Operating Margin in FY22, I can easily see them taking 30% OPM. Just so we talking about OPM, I have adjusted OPM based on future equity options and restricted stock units (RSU) that Colgate gives to it's employees and treated them as operating expenditure. That's why you see 29.16% instead of 30%.<br><br>

                    <strong>5) Reinvestment:</strong> Colgate made &#8377;4.77 of Sales on every 1 rupee of invested capital in FY22 whereas the industry makes &#8377;1.68 of Sales on every 1 rupee of invested capital. Ofcourse, other competitors deal with products other than oral care products. So, I give them an average sales to capital of 3.60 for the next 10 years (based on last 5 years numbers). The manufacturing facilities are already build, very less reinvestment (repairs and maintainence) required. The company owns and operates 4 manufacturing facilities in Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. They have a return on capital of 105.11% in FY22 which is way over there cost of capital of 7.56%. In other words, Colgate Palmolive is profitable and cash cow business.<br><br>

                    <strong>6) The Cost of Capital:</strong> I used CAPM model to find out the Cost of Equity of 7.56% and risk premiums add-ons (country + market + company) to calculate the Cost of Debt of 6.73%. The overall cost of capital (WACC), that I came up with is 7.56% based on capital structure of debt and equity, which is mostly equity.<br><br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/colgate-dcf/colgate_wacc.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/colgate-dcf/fcf.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/colgate-dcf/value.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    Based on the narrative I explained above, I came up with a fair value of &#8377;1,675.65 per share. Colgate's Stock is trading at &#8377;1,560.5 per share (July 11, 2022).<br><br>

                    <span class="head1">Sensitivity Analysis</span><br><br>

                    Is the current market price justified? If yes, What's going to happen to make that justification right?<br><br>

                    The four main value drivers of my intrinsic valuation are Revenue Growth (CAGR), Operating Profit Margin, Sales to Capital Ratio and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). Here are the four value drivers affecting price per share.<br><br>

                    <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/colgate-dcf/value_drivers.jpg"></span><br><br>

                    Just looking at the bar charts at different points, Sales to Capital Ratio do not affect a major price change. With WACC, Colgate maintains it's current WACC of 7.56%. So what we left is with Revenue Growth (CAGR) and Operating Margin (OPM) as the main drivers that affect price the most.<br><br>

                    Let's look at what's going to happen to make the current market price justifiable (keeping risk and efficiency same).<br><br>

					         <span id="dcf"><img class="dcf-image" src="assets/img/portfolio/colgate-dcf/sen_any.jpg"></span><br><br>

					         Just for some context, I forecasted revenues to grow at a 8.52% CAGR and having an operating margin of 30% for the next 10 years. I arrived at a price of &#8377;1,675.65 per share. For the current market price of &#8377;1,560.5 per share to be justifiable, Colgate Palmolive Ltd needs to maintain it's 28% operating profit margin and grow revenues by 8.52%. There are more ways to achieve the market price too!<br><br>
